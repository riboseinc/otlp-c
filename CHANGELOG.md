## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-05

Initial alpha release. The library emits OTLP/HTTP trace spans
from pure C99 with zero non-libc dependencies.

### Added — Core

- **Protobuf wire encoder** (`src/protobuf_encode.{h,c}`): varint,
  fixed64, fixed32, length-delimited primitives; typed field
  helpers with protobuf3 default-omission semantics. Bounded
  growth buffer (SIZE_MAX/2 cap). [Phase 1]
- **OTLP message encoders** (`src/otlp_messages.{h,c}`):
  just-in-time encoder from `otlp_span_t*` to wire bytes for the
  full `ExportTraceServiceRequest` envelope (Resource, Scope,
  Span, Status, KeyValue, AnyValue). [Phase 2]
- **Span builder** (`src/span.c`): opaque `otlp_span_t` with all
  14 public setters; fixed-cap (128) attribute array; deep-clone
  for exporter queueing. [Phase 4]
- **Tracer** (`src/tracer.c`): xorshift64s PRNG with C11 atomic
  CAS for lock-free multi-threaded `start_span`; W3C-style random
  trace/span IDs with all-zero rejection. [Phase 4]
- **Platform layer** (`src/platform.{c,h}`, `platform_unix.c`,
  `platform_win.c`): cross-platform clocks + non-blocking socket
  primitives (connect_nb / finish_connect / write_nb / read_nb).
  No thread / mutex / condvar abstractions. [Phase 3]
- **HTTP/1.1 client** (`src/http_client.{h,c}`): URL parser
  (`http://` only; rejects `https://`, malformed ports) +
  non-blocking POST state machine (`start`/`step`/`state`/`fd`/
  `events`) driven by the caller. [Phase 3]
- **Lock-free MPSC queue** (`src/mpsc_queue.{h,c}`): Vyukov
  bounded ring with per-slot sequence numbers on C11 atomics.
  Power-of-2 capacity, default 4096. [Phase 5]
- **Exporter** (`src/exporter.c`, `src/exporter_otel.{h,c}`):
  caller-tick model with `otlp_exporter_tick(exp, max_wait_ms)`
  and `otlp_exporter_poll_fds()`. Deep-copy `emit()` (caller may
  free immediately). Atomic stats counters. Exponential backoff
  on 429/5xx/network with attempt cap. [Phase 5]

### Added — Tests

- 7 property tests: varint (round-trip, size, extremes),
  encoder fields, span lifecycle + ID uniqueness, attribute
  round-trip, OTLP message structure, URL parser.
- 3 unit tests: smoke (API surface), HTTP echo (state machine
  against in-process server), exporter echo (end-to-end emit +
  tick + flush against in-process server).
- 1 integration test: real otelcol + Jaeger topology via
  `docker compose`; emits 100 tagged spans, queries Jaeger API,
  asserts visibility. Gated by `OTLP_C_RUN_INTEGRATION=1`.

### Added — Infrastructure

- Property-test harness (`tests/property/{prng.h,property_harness.h}`)
  with env-var seed/iteration overrides for reproducible failures.
- Test-helper echo server (`tests/test_helper_echo.{h,c}`) for
  HTTP layer and exporter tests.
- CMake build (3.20+), Ninja recommended. Options:
  `OTLP_C_BUILD_TESTS`, `OTLP_C_BUILD_EXAMPLES`,
  `OTLP_C_ENABLE_ASAN`, `OTLP_C_ENABLE_UBSAN`, `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`.
- Multi-platform CI matrix: Linux x86_64, macOS arm64, macOS
  x86_64, Windows x64. vcpkg manifest mode (zero required deps).
- `.clang-format` (Mozilla-based) + `ci/checkpatch.sh`.

### Added — Documentation

- `README.md` — pitch, comparison table, quick-start with tick
  pattern, sidecar deployment note.
- `docs/quickstart.md` — install + first program + running a
  local otelcol + Jaeger.
- `docs/deployment.md` — sidecar TLS topology (Kubernetes
  DaemonSet, sidecar container, systemd VM); why no TLS in the
  library; caller-tick embedding patterns by host environment.
- `docs/integration-test.md` — how to run the integration test.
- `examples/minimal.c` — working example emitting one span.

### Architectural commitments

- **Pure C99 baseline, C11 for `<stdatomic.h>`** (CLAUDE.md
  allows C11 atomics). No other C11 features in use.
- **Zero non-libc dependencies.** No protobuf-c, no libcurl, no
  OpenSSL, no C++ runtime.
- **No library threads, no locks.** All cross-thread data flow
  via atomics + MPSC queue. Embeddable in kernel modules,
  firmware, language VMs, libc-preload contexts.
- **Caller-driven I/O.** The library never calls `pthread_create`
  or `_beginthreadex`. `otlp_exporter_tick()` advances the
  in-flight HTTP state machine from a caller-owned thread.
- **Apache 2.0** throughout, for the eventual CNCF donation path.

### Known limitations

- Metrics (`/v1/metrics`) and Logs (`/v1/logs`) signals deferred
  to a later minor.
- TLS is **not** in the library. Production deployments use an
  otelcol sidecar for TLS termination. Direct-to-cloud HTTPS is
  not a 0.1.x use case.
- Single in-flight HTTP request per exporter. Multiple in-flight
  requests (pipelining) is post-1.0.
- DNS resolution is blocking `getaddrinfo` (one-shot per request,
  cached per exporter for the process lifetime). Non-blocking
  DNS is post-1.0.
- `ArrayValue` and `KeyValueList` AnyValue variants deferred.
- Events, links, and `trace_state` fields are not yet emitted.
- Attribute count is capped at 128 per span (compile-time).
- No JSON encoding (protobuf only).

### Compatibility

- Linux x86_64, macOS arm64, macOS x86_64, Windows x64.
- C11 compiler required (GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.8+, MSVC 2019+).
- Static and shared library configurations both supported.

### API surface

The 0.1.0 public API is in `include/otlp-c/`:

- `otlp.h` — umbrella header + `otlp_version()`.
- `version.h` — version macros.
- `status.h` — `otlp_status_t` error codes.
- `visibility.h` — `OTLP_C_EXPORT` symbol annotation.
- `span.h` — `otlp_span_t` + 14 setters + lifecycle.
- `tracer.h` — `otlp_tracer_t` + ID-generating span factory.
- `exporter.h` — `otlp_exporter_t` + `emit`/`tick`/`flush`/
  `shutdown`/`poll_fds`/`get_stats`.

Within the 0.x line, the API may break between minor versions;
changes will be documented in this file.
